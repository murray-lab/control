Run the simulation from $t = 0$ to $t=3$ in steps of $\\Delta t = 0.01$. Let the initial condition be $\\vec{x}(0) = [0.1, 0]$, and implement negative feedback control with $u(t) = -\\gamma x_1(t)$. Solve the ODE numerically for $\\gamma = 0, 1$ and $2$, and plot $y(t)$ in each case. Write a description interpreting your results, in particular explaining the difference between the cases with ($\\gamma > 0$) vs. without ($\\gamma = 0$) feedback control."
